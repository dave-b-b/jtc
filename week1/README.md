# FireFly

Welcome to FireFly. This is an application that is built to do three major things:
1. **Reintegration** (help people maintain contact with families)
2. **Reentry** (help people find resources so they are prepared to return to society)
3. **Redress** (help people file complaints against the prison for prison absues)

This application doesn't have a *"user interface"* per se, but it does have a website. The website is: [here](https://www.sendmeakite.com)
